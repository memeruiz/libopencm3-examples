README lcd-serial-touch
-----------------

This example is based on lcd-serial. The serial part is not used anymore, but it remains in case someone is interested to use it.

The goal of this example is to show the touchscreen functionality of the stm32f429discovery board.

First, it prints the contents of some configuration registers of the touchscreen IC controller (stmpe811). Then, it shows the touchscreen controller readings, the LCD corresponding coordinates and also, with a pixel dot, the current corresponding touch position.
